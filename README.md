## Introduction

Thank you for choosing AI Prompt Enhancer ("we", "our", or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience when using our extension.

This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and what rights you have in relation to it. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before using our extension.

## Information We Collect

AI Prompt Enhancer is designed with privacy as the top priority and collects minimal data:

### Local Storage Data
- **Extension Settings**: We store your preferences (like whether enhancement is enabled) locally in your browser's storage.

### Temporary Data

- Health information
- Financial information
- Authentication information
- Location data
- Browsing history
- User activity metrics
- Website content beyond the prompt text
- We do not send any data to external servers

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect solely for the purpose of enhancing your prompts:

1. **Local Processing**: All prompt enhancement is done entirely locally in your browser.
2. **No External Processing**: We do not use any external APIs or services to process your prompts.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your data to outside parties. In fact, no data leaves your browser at all during the prompt enhancement process.

## Data Security

We implement appropriate technical measures to protect your data:

- All stored data is kept locally in your browser's storage
- No data is transmitted to any external servers
- The extension only reads and enhances the prompt text you actively choose to enhance
